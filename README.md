This is an old codebase from my graduation thesis that trains a DCGAN to generate 64x64 and 128x128 underwater images. 
The dataset is composed of non-trademarked images. After running the training script and allowing sufficient epochs, 
the generator can produce entirely new, realistic underwater scenes. 

You can adjust parameters, experiment with data augmentation, and view some sample outputs in the repository.
